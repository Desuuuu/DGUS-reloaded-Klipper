# DGUS-reloaded-Klipper - ported to run on Creality CR6-SE and CR6-MAX printers

This DWIN touchscreen firmware is designed and compiled to run on the portrait-mode T5L DWIN displays provided stock with Creality CR6-SE and CR6-MAX FDM printers.

It was refactored and extended from the T5UID1 DGUS-reloaded firmware by Desuuuu which is available from [this repository](https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper).

I used the [DGUSTool V8.2.1.14](https://github.com/CR6Community/CR-6-touchscreen/blob/extui/Tools/DGUS_Tool_V8.2.1.14.7z), to create a new DWIN_SET project in portrait-mode, based on version 1.0.2 of the landscape-mode project by Desuuuu.

In the course of the refactoring process, I have:
1. Rearranged and redesigned some of the screens, to suit my own preferences for 3D-printing workflow with the Creality CR6-SE printer.  
2. Renamed some of the buttons and labels, to use the terms used in the CR6Community Firmware UI, with the idea of (hopefully) reducing the learning barrier for CR6Community members wanting to use this Klipper interface.
3. Removed a few controls/displays that were not working as intended and which my limited python skills did not enable me to troubleshoot and fix.
4. Made a few small edits to a couple of the files in the DGUS-reloaded modified version of Klipper with which this DWIN_SET must be paired.

## Features

This firmware was inspired by the CR6Community Firmware touchscreen firmware, but it is NOT as feature-rich as the CR6Community Firmware. 

Features present in this version of the UI include:
* Status message available on most screens
* Z offset, manual and automatic leveling
* PID autotuning for Nozzle and for Bed
* Beeper Volume adjustment
* Display Brightness adjustment
* Playing sounds with the Beeper, using M300 (the frequency parameter is the index of the audio file)
- A printing status page, with a Tuning menu and Pause/Resume/Cancel print controls 

## How to Contribute

CR6Community Firmware features NOT present in this release may be developed in future releases, but no schedule commitment is possible for such extensions.  Users who are able to define and develop such modifications are welcome to fork this repository and to submit Pull Requests or to open Discussions or Issues as appropriate, to propose those changes.

## Compatibility
This firmware is intended to work on any CR6-SE or CR6-MAX, regardless of whether that machine is fully stock or substantially modified. (It even includes a manual leveling screen, for those of you who have installed manual bed-leveling wheels.)

This firmware **should** be compatible with any configuration of CR6-SE or CR6-MAX printer.
**CAUTION:** The automatic bed-leveling function provided with this version of the firmware ONLY works if you configure your printer.cfg to perform a 5x5 bed mesh.  If you do not want to use a 5x5 mesh, do not use this ABL function.

Testing has been done on the following machine:

* Creality CR6-SE, modified with:
    - a BTT SKR CR6 v1.0 motherboard
    - a direct drive Orbiter v1.5 extruder
    - a Dragon HF hotend
    - a PEI flexible magnetic sheet

## Prerequisites
You have to use this [modified version of Klipper](https://github.com/Desuuuu/klipper). Make sure to enable the serial connection to the screen while configuring the MCU firmware.

The only modification required to your Klipper printer.cfg file is to add this section:
```
[t5uid1]
firmware: dgus_reloaded
```
The full recommended [t5uid1] section is included with the project, as t5uid1.cfg.
For a complete list of all available options, see the [sample-t5uid1.cfg](https://github.com/Desuuuu/klipper/blob/master/config/sample-t5uid1.cfg) file.

Example Klipper configurations are available in [the Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper-config repository](https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper-config).

## Additional help is available in the Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper-config Wiki
* [Flashing the firmware](https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper/wiki/Flashing-the-firmware)
* [Print status](https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper/wiki/Print-status)
* [Print progress display](https://github.com/Desuuuu/DGUS-reloaded-Klipper/wiki/Print-progress-display)

## Modification / Compilation
You can make modifications to the firmware by opening the `DWprj.hmi` file in **DGUS Tools**.
You can edit the graphics using a simple bitmap editing tool, like Windows PAINT.

After finishing your modifications, you will need to press the *Generate* command from the DGUSTool File menu to update the 3 required binary files (13TouchFile.bin, 14ShowFile.bin and 22_Config.bin) in the DWIN_SET folder.
If you modified any of the screen layouts, icons or buttons, you will also need to use the ICL tool to regenerate the applicable ICL file(s) (intuitively named: 24_icons.icl, 27_buttons.icl, 32_screens.icl, 30_progress_left.icl and 37_progress_right.icl).

You can then flash your touchscreen using the resulting `DWIN_SET` folder.

If you add any data variable display widgets to any of the screens, you also need to edit the DGUS-reloaded Klipper file pages.cfg in ~/klipper/klippy/extras/t5uid1/dgus-reloaded, so that the data will be refreshed and maintained when that screen is being displayed.
I have included that modified file for this distribution, for you to overwrite the stock (Desuuuu) pages.cfg when you install this CR6 version of the UI.

If you wish to modify the nozzle and bed temperature presets for PLA, ABS and/or PETG, you will need to modify the file _init_.py in the folder ~/klipper/klippy/extras/t5uid1/dgus-reloaded, so that the program will initialize those variables with the values of your choosing.
I have included that modified file for this distribution, for you to overwrite the stock (Desuuuu) _init_.py when you install this CR6 version of the UI. (CAUTION: There is more than one file named  _init_.py in the t5uid1 application. Be sure you are in the right directory when overwriting the stock one with the modified one.)
