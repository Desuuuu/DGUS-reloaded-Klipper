Sorry, I only have a CR6-SE with a BTT SKR CR6 motherboard, on which to test things.

If you have a 4.5.2, 4.5.3 or 1.1.0.3 board, please use the make menuconfig and make commands to build your own firmware.bin file.

If you are then willing to share that file with others, please feel free to upload it to this repo in an Issue and I will add it to the distribution folders.

Thanks!
